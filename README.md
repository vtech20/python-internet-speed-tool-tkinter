# Description
The ubiquitous nature of the internet has woven itself into the fabric of our daily routines. Post-pandemic, it has seamlessly integrated into our professional lives, shaping how we work from home and even influencing how we order our meals. The significance of a swift internet connection cannot be overstated in the contemporary landscape. Occasionally, we find ourselves grappling with sluggish internet speeds, prompting us to resort to online tools or applications to assess its velocity. While numerous internet speed testing tools populate the market, this project takes a unique approach by crafting a bespoke Internet Speed Tester using Python. This application, designed with the tkinter and speedtest modules, necessitates the user's computer to be actively connected to the internet for optimal functionality.
